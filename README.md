This Project was a test to see if it is possible to create a pdf using Html styling and then export this as a pdf.

## Mentions
I took the basis of this project from William Kwok and modiefied it to allow resizing depending of the screenSize, as well as multiple pages.
There where also some updates regarding SVG Support necessary since the library he used changed a lot since his post.
